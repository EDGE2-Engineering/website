CONCRETE AND PRE-CASTED BLOCKS
Our laboratory is equipped with the "Matest Servoplus Evolution," a high-performance digital compression testing machine that boasts a 2000kN and 500kN capacity for two load frames. Additionally, we have automatic flexure testing machines designed to ensure the reliability and consistency of flexural testing on standard concrete beams.

Some notable features of the Digital Compression Testing Machine include a digital graphic display that provides real-time load versus time graphs and precise pace rate control.

Below, you will find a list of tests conducted in our laboratory to assess the quality of concrete and precast blocks, including tests performed on building bricks.
	•	Dimension
	•	Compressive Strength
	•	Efflorescence
	•	Water Absorption

Test conducted on Solid & Hollow Blocks
	•	Dimension
	•	Compressive Strength
	•	Water Absorption
	•	Block Density

Test Conducted on Paver Blocks
	•	Compressive Strength
	•	Water Absorption
	•	Laboratory has also facility to find out the Strength of Hardened Concrete. In this procedure, concrete is extracted in the form of cores or cylinders from reinforced concrete structures devoid of any reinforcement and subsequently transported to the laboratory for the purpose of determining the concrete's strength.
    •	Our laboratory is equipped to conduct the ACCELERATED-CURED CONCRETE TEST, which employs an Accelerated Curing Method to attain rapid compressive strength results in concrete. This approach is also employed to determine the 28-day compressive strength of concrete within a mere 28 hours.	•	Compressive Strength below mentioned Materials are also determined.
	•	Concrete Cubes
	•	Concrete Core
	•	Kerb Stones
	•	Concrete Covering etc.,
