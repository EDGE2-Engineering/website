CONCRETE AND PRE-CASTED BLOCKS
Our Laboratory is Equipped with “Matest Servoplus Evolution” high performance Digital Compression Testing Machine with a capacity of two load frames 2000kN, 500kN. In addition to the above we also have Automatic Flexure Testing Machines which have been designed to meet the need for reliable and consistent testing of Flexural test on standard concrete beams.
Some Key Feature of Digital Compression Testing Machine is Digital Graphic Display allows Real Time Load Vs Time Graph and Accurate maintenance of Pace rate control.
Below are some of the Test conducted in our laboratory to Determine the Quality of Concrete and Pre-Casted Blocks.
Test conducted on Building Bricks.
	•	Dimension
	•	Compressive Strength
	•	Efflorescence
	•	Water Absorption

Test conducted on Solid & Hollow Blocks
	•	Dimension
	•	Compressive Strength
	•	Water Absorption
	•	Block Density
Test Conducted on Paver Blocks
	•	Compressive Strength
	•	Water Absorption

	•	Laboratory has also facility to find out the Strength of Hardened Concrete,                   In this method Concrete is extracted in the shape of Cores / Cylinders from Reinforced Concrete Members free from reinforcement, then sent to laboratory to find out the Strength of Concrete.

	•	Laboratory has also facility to perform ACCELERATED-CURED CONCRETE TEST, Accelerated Curing Method is used to get early Compressive Strength in concrete. This method is also used to find out 28 days compressive strength of concrete in 28 hours.
	•	Compressive Strength below mentioned Materials are also determined.
	•	Concrete Cubes
	•	Concrete Core
	•	Kerb Stones
	•	Concrete Covering etc.,
