STEEL
Our laboratory is furnished with the "UTE120HGFL," an electronic universal testing machine with hydraulic grip front loading capabilities. This machine, manufactured by FIE, is designed for conducting a wide range of material tests involving tension, compression, bending, transverse, and shear loads.

The FIE Electronic Universal Testing Machine is fully compliant with Grade "A" of BS: 1610: Part1:1992 and Class 1 of IS-1828-Part1:1991 standards and offers a substantial load capacity of 1200kN.

Our laboratory conducts both physical and chemical tests on steel materials in accordance with Indian Standards.

Physical test conducted in Laboratory are as follows:
	•	Weight / Meter
	•	Ultimate Tensile Strength
	•	Yield Strength
	•	Bend Test & Re-Bend
	•	The laboratory also offers testing of TMT Bar with Coupler



Chemical Analysis of Steel
In our laboratory, we have the "MOSS Optical Emission Spectrometer," which is the most recent compact optical emission spectrometer (OES) available globally. This advanced instrument offers incredibly fast analysis, with results typically obtained in 25 seconds or less, making it suitable for analyzing various types of metals.
Below are some of the key features of Moss OES:
	•	Compact, Scalable arc-spark OES
	•	Fully digital, Current controlled plasma source
	•	Modular and scalable applications that scale with user requirements.
	•	Multi base without limitations
	•	Analysis of C, S, P, N etc. to <50ppm.
	•	Exceptional accuracy, precision, and repeatability.

Chemical test conducted in Laboratory are as follows:
In chemical tests, the maximum allowable percentage of the following constituents is established:
	•	Carbon
	•	Sulphur
	•	Phosphorus
	•	Carbon + Sulphur
	•	Carbon Equivalent
