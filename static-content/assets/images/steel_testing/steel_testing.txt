STEEL
Our Laboratory is Equipped with “UTE120HGFL” Hydraulic Grip Front Loading Electronic Universal Testing Machine manufactured in FIE for testing materials under tension, compression bending, transverse and shear loads. FIE Electronic Universal Testing Machine complies with Grade “A” of BS: 1610: Part1:1992 and class 1 of IS-1828-Part1:1991.
Load Capacity: 1200kN
Some of the Key feature of UTM are open type cross head, Printer & PC graphs enable study the behavior of the material, Motor driven threaded columns for quick effortless adjustment of lower cross-head-to facilitate rapid fixing of test specimen, Simple controls for ease of operation, The hydraulic pump provides continuously non-pulsating oil flow. Hence the load application is very smooth. For Hydraulic Wedge action grips separate control remote is provided with selector switches indicating clamp, declamp and null positions.
Both Physical & Chemical tests are conducted for Steel as per Indian Standards
Physical test conducted in Laboratory are as follows:
	•	Weight / Meter
	•	Ultimate Tensile Strength
	•	Yield Strength
	•	Bend Test & Re-Bend
	•	The laboratory also offers testing of TMT Bar with Coupler


Chemical Analysis of Steel
Our laboratory is equipped with “MOSS Optical Emission Spectrometer”.
MOSS is the World’s Latest Compact Optical Emission Spectrometer (OES). Having a rapid analysis time of 25 seconds or less across all type of Metals
Below are some of the key features of Moss OES:
	•	Compact, Scalable arc-spark OES
	•	Fully digital, Current controlled plasma source
	•	Modular and scalable applications that scale with user requirements.
	•	Multi base without limitations
	•	Analysis of C, S, P, N etc. to <50ppm.
	•	Exceptional accuracy, precision, and repeatability.
Chemical test conducted in Laboratory are as follows:
In Chemical test maximum permissible percentage of below mentioned constituents are determined:
	•	Carbon
	•	Sulphur
	•	Phosphorus
	•	Carbon + Sulphur
	•	Carbon Equivalent
