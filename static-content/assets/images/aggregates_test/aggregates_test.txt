Aggregates undergo testing for strength, toughness, hardness, shape, and water absorption to determine their suitability for various construction purposes.
Below, you'll find a list of some of the tests performed on both coarse and fine aggregates in accordance with Indian Standards.
	•	Sieve Analysis
	•	Bulk Density (Loose &Compacted)
	•	Materials finer than 75micron
	•	Specific Gravity & Water Absorption
	•	Flakiness & Elongation Index
	•	10% Fines Value
	•	Aggregate Crushing Value
	•	Aggregate Impact Value
	•	Bulking
	•	Los-Angeles Abrasion Test
